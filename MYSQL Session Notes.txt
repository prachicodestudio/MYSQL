What is a Database ?

The database is a collection of inter-related data which is used to retrieve, insert and delete the data efficiently. 
It is also used to organize the data in the form of a table, schema, views, and reports, etc.

C - Create
R- Read
U - Update
D - Delete


Example : The college Database organizes the data about the admin, staff, students and faculty etc.

Using the database, you can easily retrieve, insert, and delete the information.

SQL (Structure Query Language)- used to communicate with the database to perform different kinds of operations.

Components of Database
----------------------
1) Server - actual data is stored
2) Client - used to perform operations on databse server

1) Working on MySQL Workbench & Command prompt client
2) SQL Commands

Types of SQL Commands
-----------------------
1. DDL (Data Definition Language)
Create, Alter, Drop, Truncate , Rename
Commands are auto committed

2. DML (Data Manupulation Language)
Insert, Update, Delete
DML Commands are not auto commited means it cant permanetly save all the changes in the database. They can be rollback.

3. DCL (Data Control Language) (Administrative use)
Grant, Revoke

4. TCL (Transaction Control Language)
Commit , Rollback, Savepoint

5. DQL (Data Query Language)
Select

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXIST databasename;
CREATE SCHEMA databasename;

DROP DATABASE databaseName;
DROP SCHEMA databaseName;

CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE(Name VARCHAR(20), Email VARCHAR(100), DOB DATE);  
describe Student;


INSERT INTO Student values(1, "Prachi", 77);
INSERT INTO Student (SNO, SNAME, MARKS)values(1, "Prachi", 77);

set path=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin;



SQL Datatypes
--------------
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    PersonID int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Address varchar(255),
    City varchar(255)
);

Numeric
Text
Date/Time


->WHERE CLAUSE
-------------
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Session-04
-----------

ORDER BY (For Sorting the rows in the result)

SELECT 
   select_list
FROM 
   table_name
ORDER BY 
   column1 [ASC|DESC], 
   column2 [ASC|DESC],
   ...;


MySQL DISTINCT clause  to remove duplicates from the result given by the SELECT clause.

SELECT DISTINCT
    select_list
FROM
    table_name
WHERE 
    search_condition
ORDER BY 
    sort_expression;


Session-05

OPERATORS
---------
AND operator
It is used in the WHERE clause of the SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE statements to form a condition.
The AND operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;


Or Operator

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

Ex1.

SELECT    
	customername, 
	country
FROM    
	customers
WHERE country = 'USA' OR 
      country = 'France';

Ex2.

SELECT   
	customername, 
	country, 
	creditLimit
FROM   
	customers
WHERE(country = 'USA'
		OR country = 'France')
	  AND creditlimit > 100000;

The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions are TRUE.
The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.


Not Operator
The NOT operator is used in combination with other operators to give the opposite result

NOT LIKE
NOT BETWEEN
NOT IN
NOT GREATER THAN (>)
NOT LESS THAN (<)

IN Opertator
The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
