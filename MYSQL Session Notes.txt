File Management System
-----------------------
Information / data stored in file.
MS Excel

What is a Database ?

The database is a collection of inter-related data which is used to retrieve, insert and delete the data efficiently. 
It is also used to organize the data in the form of a table, schema, views, and reports, etc.

C - Create
R- Read
U - Update
D - Delete


Example : The college Database organizes the data about the admin, staff, students and faculty etc.

Using the database, you can easily retrieve, insert, and delete the information.

Types Of Database
-----------------
1) DBMS ( Database management System) Dbase, Foxpro 
2) RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) - MySQL, SQL Serever, DB2, Oracle, MS-Access..

SQL (Structure Query Language)- used to communicate with the database to perform different kinds of operations.

Components of Database
----------------------
1) Server - actual data is stored
2) Client - used to perform operations on databse server

Types of client
---------------
Graphical user Interface client
Command line client

MySQL Clients
-------------
MySQL Workbench (GUI Client)
MySQL Shell (CLI Client)
Toad
Squirell

Session-02
--------------

1) Working on MySQL Workbench & Command prompt client
2) SQL Commands

Types of SQL Commands
-----------------------
1. DDL (Data Definition Language)
Create, Alter, Drop, Truncate , Rename
Commands are auto committed

2. DML (Data Manupulation Language)
Insert, Update, Delete
DML Commands are not auto commited means it cant permanetly save all the changes in the database. They can be rollback.

3. DCL (Data Control Language) (Administrative use)
Grant, Revoke

4. TCL (Transaction Control Language)
Commit , Rollback, Savepoint

5. DQL (Data Query Language)
Select

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXIST databasename;
CREATE SCHEMA databasename;

DROP DATABASE databaseName;
DROP SCHEMA databaseName;

CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE(Name VARCHAR(20), Email VARCHAR(100), DOB DATE);  
describe Student;


INSERT INTO Student values(1, "Prachi", 77);
INSERT INTO Student (SNO, SNAME, MARKS)values(1, "Prachi", 77);

How to select Data from the table?
Select 

mysql -u root -p employees < employees.sql

set path=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin;

Error Code: 1075. Incorrect table definition; there can be only one auto column and it must be defined as a key



SQL Datatypes
--------------
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    PersonID int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Address varchar(255),
    City varchar(255)
);

Numeric
Text
Date/Time


->WHERE CLAUSE
-------------
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Session-04
-----------

ORDER BY (For Sorting the rows in the result)

SELECT 
   select_list
FROM 
   table_name
ORDER BY 
   column1 [ASC|DESC], 
   column2 [ASC|DESC],
   ...;


MySQL DISTINCT clause  to remove duplicates from the result given by the SELECT clause.

SELECT DISTINCT
    select_list
FROM
    table_name
WHERE 
    search_condition
ORDER BY 
    sort_expression;


Session-05

OPERATORS
---------
AND operator
It is used in the WHERE clause of the SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE statements to form a condition.
The AND operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;


Or Operator

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

Ex1.

SELECT    
	customername, 
	country
FROM    
	customers
WHERE country = 'USA' OR 
      country = 'France';

Ex2.

SELECT   
	customername, 
	country, 
	creditLimit
FROM   
	customers
WHERE(country = 'USA'
		OR country = 'France')
	  AND creditlimit > 100000;

The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions are TRUE.
The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.


Not Operator
The NOT operator is used in combination with other operators to give the opposite result

NOT LIKE
NOT BETWEEN
NOT IN
NOT GREATER THAN (>)
NOT LESS THAN (<)

IN Opertator
The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

DDL Commands


Primary Key
A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table.  

Rules of Primary Key:

1) A primary key must contain unique values. If the primary key consists of multiple columns, the combination of values in these columns must be unique.

2 )A primary key column cannot have NULL values. Any attempt to insert or update NULL to primary key columns will result in an error. 
MySQL implicitly adds a NOT NULL constraint to primary key columns.

3) A table can have one an only one primary key.
DROP TABLE table_name;

DDL Commands (Auto committed)
---------------------------------
1) Create Table- Used for creating database objects like a database and a database table, views, Triggers etc.

2) Alter Table - Used for modifying and renaming elements of an existing database table. Add new column, Drop column, Modify existing column, Rename column 

3) Truncate Table- Used to remove all the records from a database table.
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

DELETE FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE Condition; (DML, not auto committed)

4) Drop Table- Used for removing an entire database or a database table.
DROP TABLE table_name;

5) Rename Table- Used to change the name of the database table.

RENAME TABLE old_table _name To new_table_name; 

ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;
